# Multi-Repo Orchestration

When you are assigned an issue in this repository that requires work across multiple codebases, follow this process using tools from the GitHub MCP Server:

## Step 1: Analyze the Feature Request

1. Read the issue description carefully
2. Load the dependency map from `dependencies.json` in this skill's directory
3. Determine which repositories are affected based on the feature scope:
   - **Frontend work** (UI components, pages, routing, Tailwind styling) → `your-org/octocat-supply-web`
   - **API work** (Express routes, repository classes, models, migrations, Swagger docs) → `your-org/octocat-supply-api`
## Step 2: Create Linked Issues in Dependent Repos

For each affected repository, use the `create_issue` tool:

**Issue Title Format:**
```
[octocat-supply-platform#<ISSUE_NUMBER>] <Specific task description>
```

**Issue Body Template:**
```markdown
## Parent Issue
This task was spawned from your-org/octocat-supply-platform#<ISSUE_NUMBER>

## Task Description
<Specific requirements for this repository>

## Architecture Context
<Relevant specs from the master repo>

## OctoCAT Entity Model
Entities: Supplier, Product, Order, OrderDetail, Delivery, OrderDetailDelivery, Headquarters, Branch

## Integration Notes
- Depends on: <list any cross-repo dependencies>
- Provides: <what this repo contributes to the feature>

```

**Assignees:** Always assign `copilot` to each spawned issue.

## Step 3: Update the Master Issue

After creating all dependent issues, use the `add_issue_comment` tool to update the master issue:

```markdown
## 🚀 Multi-Repo Tasks Spawned

| Repository | Issue | Scope |
|------------|-------|-------|
| octocat-supply-api | your-org/octocat-supply-api#XXX | Express API endpoints + SQLite migrations |
| octocat-supply-web | your-org/octocat-supply-web#XXX | React UI components + routes |

### Recommended Integration Order
1. ⏳ `octocat-supply-api` - Express routes + repository classes (no dependencies)
2. ⏳ `octocat-supply-web` - React components + Tailwind styling (depends on api)

### Tracking
I will monitor progress and update this issue when PRs are created.
```

## Step 4: Monitor Progress

Periodically use `search_issues` to check for PRs that reference this master issue, and update the tracking comment accordingly.
